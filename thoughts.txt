Insert INTO dp_tmp.adhoc_bulk_data(campaign_id,msisdn,gcg_flag,sms_text,broadcast_Date,masking,stakeholder,sms_type,sms_priority,campaign_name,service_code,channel,time_stamp)
select
distinct 100 as CAMPAIGN_ID,

title               string
BROADCAST_DATE      DATE
MASKING             enum [Jazz , JAZZ]
